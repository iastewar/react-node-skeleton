# React test

## Setup

Run ```npm install``` in both the client and server directories.

## Development

Run ```npm start``` in the client directory to start a development server for the react app. Run ```node app.js``` in the server directory to start a server. You should have both running at the same time (e.g. 2 seperate terminal windows).

## Building and deploying

In the client directory run ```npm run build```, then you can run the server (in server directory) with ```node app.js```.
